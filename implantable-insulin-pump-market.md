<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Insulin Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-Loop Insulin Pump</li><li>Open-Loop Insulin Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable insulin pump market is divided into two main types: closed-loop and open-loop insulin pumps. Closed-loop insulin pumps, often referred to as automated insulin delivery systems, continuously monitor blood glucose levels and automatically adjust insulin delivery, enhancing glycemic control and reducing the burden on users. In contrast, open-loop insulin pumps require users to manually adjust their insulin doses based on their blood sugar readings, offering flexibility but demanding more user involvement in diabetes management.</p></p>
