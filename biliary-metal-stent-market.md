<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biliary Metal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Version</li><li>Non-Covered Version</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biliary metal stent market is categorized into two primary types: covered and non-covered versions. Covered biliary stents have an outer layer that prevents tissue ingrowth, which enhances patency and reduces the risk of obstruction. In contrast, non-covered stents lack this protective layer, leading to a higher likelihood of blockage but may be preferred in certain cases due to ease of placement and reduced cost. Both types serve to alleviate biliary obstruction in patients with various underlying conditions.</p></p>
