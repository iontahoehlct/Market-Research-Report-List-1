<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wifi IP Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Camera</li><li>Decentralized IP Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wi-Fi IP camera market is primarily divided into two types: centralized and decentralized IP cameras. Centralized IP cameras rely on a central network video recorder (NVR) for storage and management, offering easier maintenance and streamlined access to feeds. In contrast, decentralized IP cameras function independently, using cloud storage or on-camera recording, which enhances security and reduces reliance on a central system. Both types serve various surveillance needs, with centralized cameras often favored for larger installations and decentralized for flexibility and scalability.</p></p>
