<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Aluminate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-melting</li><li>Sintered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The calcium aluminate market is primarily divided into two types: pre-melting and sintered. Pre-melting calcium aluminate is produced by melting raw materials to create a homogenous material with specific properties useful for applications like refractory binders and cement additives. Sintered calcium aluminate, on the other hand, is formed through the calcination of raw materials at high temperatures, resulting in a more stable and durable product. Both types serve diverse industrial applications, particularly in construction and metallurgy.</p></p>
